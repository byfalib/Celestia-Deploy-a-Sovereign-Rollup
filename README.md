# Celestia-Deploy-a-Sovereign-Rollup

## Deploy a soverign rollup

## Description

Deploy a Sovereign Rollup with Rollkit.
It can be a regular Cosmos-SDK rollup or an Ethermint Rollup. You can find tutorials on deploying sovereign rollups with Rollkit [here](https://rollkit.dev/docs/tutorials/building-and-deploying-a-rollup/).

## Direction

Submission is limited to only 1, do not submit more than one.
Deploy your own sovereign rollup on top of the Blockspace Race network.
If deploying a Cosmos-SDK rollup, extra points are given if your rollup has unique functionality.
If deploying an existing Cosmos-SDK app as a rollup on top of Celestia, that would be also great to see.
You can also deploy an Ethermint or Cosmwasm rollup with a special application built on top of it.

## Judging criteria

Full points awarded for deploying your own unique rollup with documentation. Extra points awarded if you can write up a deployment script to allow anyone to deploy a Cosmos-SDK rollup with Rollkit.
No points if deploying a vanilla rollup (like just copying what is in the docs). Furthermore, no points given if you don't provide a Github repository.
